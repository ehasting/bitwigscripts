# bitwigscripts
## MPD26.control.js
A short controller script for mapping mpd26 to bitwig.  
You need to run the default generic template located on slot 17 and onwards to get this to work,
K1-K6 is mapped to macro1 - macro6
Transport controllers is mapped to its equalents in bitwig

TODO: Make a better forward/rewind. Make it response to holding down button.
TODO: Map all macro buttons in a better way, still missing 7 and 8, but the layout is not optimal.
